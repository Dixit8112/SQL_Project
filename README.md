# SQL Credit Card Transaction Analysis
Welcome to my portfolio showcasing my SQL skills through a project focused on credit card transaction analysis. In this project, I applied advanced SQL techniques to analyze and derive insights from transaction data.

## SQL Skills and Expertise
Throughout this project, I leveraged several SQL concepts to solve business problems, including:

**CTEs (Common Table Expressions):** Used for creating complex queries and recursive data retrieval.
**Aggregations & Grouping:** Summed transaction amounts, calculated percentage contributions, and identified key spending patterns.
**Joins:** Combined data from multiple tables to produce comprehensive insights.
**Window Functions:** Employed RANK() and LAG() for ranking and analyzing time-based trends.
**Subqueries:** Utilized for detailed data extraction and filtering.
